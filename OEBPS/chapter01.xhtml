    <h1>Silly content for display</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first paragraph in an ePub digital book (i.e., an
      electronic book, or e-book). This test is meant to be akin to a
      programmer's "Hello, World!" application, but since we need the
      content of the book to be at least moderately long, so that there are
      reflows, I am trying to be verbose.
    </p>

    <p>
      I expect that the line breakings of ebook readers
      like <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/">FBReader</a> will be, in
      particular, a little more beautiful than those presented by the
      competition, since it uses a good hypenation algorithm (the same that
      Prof. Knuth uses in his superb TeX engine?).

    <h2>Brief description of an ePub archive</h2>
    <p>
      An ePub archive is composed of three parts:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	The "content", being constituted of a set of XHTML files (the "real"
	content of the book), together with Cascading Style Sheets (being a
	subset of the CSS 2.0 standard, with a few extra properties).
      </li>
      <li>
	Accompanying the content per se, there is a description of the
	structure of the book, in XML format. This description is made up of
	a manifest file
      </li>
      <li>
	The final step is just packing it up all in a ZIP file, and with
	extension <code>.epub</code>. The files inside this container should
	be in a hierarchy as given by:
      </li>
    </ul>
