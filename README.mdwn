# A "Hello, World!" version of an ePub ebook.
    
Some gotchas:
    
* The directory strucure is not obvious at all and it appears to have some
  variation from descriptions around the internet.
    
* The `.epub` file is just a zip file that has:
    1. A certain directory strucure (see below)
    2. A requirement that the first file, `mimetype`, to be stored
       uncompressed, have exactly the contents `application/epub+zip` with
       no trailing CR, LF, NL etc., and have no special attributes or extra
       fields.
    3. The tree hierarchy looks approximately like this:
	
            .
            ├── mimetype
            ├── META-INF
            │   └── container.xml
            └── OEBPS
                ├── book.ncx
                ├── book.opf
                └── chapter01.xhtml
    
* The file `container.xml` serves as a "bootstrap" for the book.
    
* The `.opf` file contains at a minimum, metadata of the book, the list of
  all files (except for `mimetype`, `container.xml`, and the `.opf`) that
  compose the book, with their full path, IDs and media-types, and, lastly,
  the "linear" list of topics in which the book should be read.
    
* The content of the `dc:identifier` element of the `.opf` file has to match
  the property of the `meta` element with name `dtb:uid`.  Otherwise,
  http://www.threepress.org/document/epub-validate/ does not validate the
  document.
